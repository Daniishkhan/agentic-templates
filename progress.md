## Done
- Simplified planning model to one backlog file: `docs/epic.md`.
- Restored epic-first workflow: onepager -> PRD -> epic -> execution.
- Added machine-readable Story Index block inside `docs/epic.md` for status/dependency tracking.
- Updated `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, scaffold docs, and `scripts/context-brief.sh` to follow this model.

## Inactive / Blocked
- (none)

## Needs Rework
- (none)

## Next Up
- Use `docs/epic.md` Story Index to mark first story `ready`, then execute it.
